I've had enough Batman.
Thanks alot COVID
"When we finish the Phase 5 and 6, I’m going to take a break from Marvel in the future 😣"
I can't wait to see Chris Evans Captain America meet Chris Evans Johnny Storm.
It makes sense but no one can replace RDJ
"Rebooting the mcu from the beginning with he xmen spidey and fantastic 4 from the very beginning,,,Yes Please!"
John Krasinski looked absolutely fantastic as reeds 🙌
Dr strange the slave master supreme
No one can replace Chadwick and Jeremy if he don't recover
I just want a MF DOOM soundtrack on a Dr doom movie
Jeremy please make a full recovorey
Maybe even Ed Norton as hulk
Imagine we get a director like Christopher Nolan to direct secret wars.
"what im most interested in is if they regroup all past marvel type characters with current or future, what would they do with actors that played an old version of another character, Human torch for example"
Possibly even George Clooney as batman
Possibly even George Clooney as Batman
Dean Cain as superman
Dean Cain as Superman
After secret wars is the mutants saga so no more avengers
"Tom Cruise was initially offered the role of Tony Stark, if Marvel will allow him to risk his life to do his own wild stunts as usual it could workout."
Does this mean Daniel IS the werewolf?
What about Hawkeye
I hope they don't pick and choose different characters from multiverses since that would feel like all the past decade and more of plot are for nothing but it could be a soft reboot in some way like properly bringing xmen and other characters that haven't been in the MCU before
Marvel is dead. Disney is just flogging the horse they decapitated with wokeness.
6:53 As what VFX are being overworked to do to them.
Funny how ScreenCrush always gives and shot out to NR but NR never does.
"One thing I noticed from this video is. MCU is full of mid to low tier characters. Hulk, Strange, Spiderman and Thor are prob the only Top tier they got. Until the X-Men and F4 are introduced."
I hope captain America comes back
I've had enough Batman. Never really cared for him.
The Loki series can play a big part in setting it all up!
Secret Wars is probably gonna be 10 hours long.
"I just hope that Kang Dynasty is actually a Dynasty. Age of Ultron was a few days, at best. MOM wasn’t really any madness and the multiverses we actually spent time in were kind of meh. Pizza balls and reverse crossing lights don’t count. That was lazy as hell."
"With Dc doing a reboot and possibly marvel, i wonder if its a plan between Gunn and Kevin to create a storyline that would eventually end with a crossover that would make sense for both DC and Marvel."
I want RDJ back. :)
What more do u want that's enough
"Are we ever going to be seeing galactus in the MCU, I hope so"
I think the whole Kang thing is a big misdirect and there is something even worse on the horizon!
is it  the decade of the Multiverse. im ok with that....
"I still think it’s a shame they brought all the Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and that lot then only used The Devil when actually they’d just spent four series giving back stories and a couple of programmes of them together as a group and that’s it"
Expecting an extensive reboot in 2028. Feige will step down and hand over the reigns. MCU will be 20; time to reset the clock. Any contracts known to extend beyond that date?
I'm good off Tony stark. Let the dead rest
The image of Wong pouring one back with a stressful grimace coupled with the idea of him carrying the MCU on his back absolutely broke me
I still say that Chris Evans should reprise the role of Johnny Blaze as a variant & have him in shots with Chris ALSO playing old 616 Captain America...
Can we get the Netflix Defenders in secret wars please
Love Daniel Craig hopefully he joins the MCU
"Marvel is in a good place right now, everything that comes out now from marvel should be a pleasant surprise"
"As much as I love Robert jr. And Hugh jackman along with the spider triplets, my hopes will be low u til fully confirmed to come back in secret wars"
A reboot would not surprise me considering the countless reboots for comics
Def think this was the big plan for sure
Michael Keaton is still my batman =P
"Please please please let AOS crossover to the MCU, i really wanna see Daisy with the Avengers"
Let's get Dacre Montgomery as wolverine or a grown Franklin Richards 🤙
We have had enough Batman and Superman lets be real about this. Make a movie with ANY other superhero. Take a risk.
We need “what if” marvel movies
This would solve the main issue of live action characters played by actors who do age and who do eventually want to do other projects.
does anybody else think that caleb mclaughlin should play miles morales?
If Batman had that satisfying of a death I would want them to not use Batman again
I love newrockstars
Daniel Craig should be Magneto in the MCU.
im expecting a mcu reboot (in a certain way) after secret wars.
When you start replacing characters people like you loose it all.     Look at fast and furious
We've had enough Tony Stark. I love him. Don't get me wrong. Greatest super hero of all time. But he is dead. At most we could have a slight Cameo from an alternate reality Tony Stark. But I hope it's JUST a cameo. A nod to one of the greatest heroes of all time. But I think we move on to the next generation of heroes. I think Captain America has the potential for a Marvel Special about him returning the stones and his decision to stay in the past. But other than that I'd say a cameo would be good. Anything more than that those two would be too much. A Captain America special + a cameo in Secret Wars and a Cameo from RDJ in secret Wars. That's it. No more.
Too early for miles morales
They shouldn’t reboot.
Daniel Craig should be playing Megneto in MCU. Why make him another.
I've had enough Batman...
there's no more RDJ tony. knock it off
rdj is the best plz never think about recasting him .... tom cruise is great ... but rdj !!!
"I think after secret wars. Sa MCU will be rebooted with Mutants and F4 will be the main characters. (Mutant saga) . And the next movies will not be ""avengers"" but will be X-Men Movies."
Voss has a bigger following than all of NR 😂
Where’s Bucky next
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 for Jeremy Renner. I’m ok with a reboot of the MCU as long as the story is good.
"Shocked to see Daniel Craig reaction in that interview. I would liek to see him on MCU, but maybe in the villain side."
It’s 2023.. imagine what an iron movie could be like today
if they do secrete  wars without doom im going to be pissed
Maria Hill has been a Skrull all along...
I just want to see another Pietro and this time not get wasted.
"what if avengers 6 is the start of a trilogy, the next 6 years after avengers 6 of the mcu movies are all set in the battleworld"
"Damn right, “we haven’t had enough Batman”! 👏🏽"
Where does Wanda play into this?
Mantis is clearly in the box BEHIND Prof X. Lol
Just bring downeys tony back as A.I that leads avengers 👍🏻
"Wouldn't this also confirm that atleast initially, 838 was planned to be the ""what if"" timeline with Cap Carter and the Hydra Stomper?"
I think it will be a reboot of the MCU so they'll have a chance to do anything and it makes sense
Henry Cavill as Wolverine please
Kinda sad the MCU isnt as exciting anymore with the og avengers gone
If you be there all go
O
Rdj passing the torch to Tom cruise is going to be fire
Sure exited of some of whats comming but at the same time its so much i just cant wait for all of this to be over. It wont be any time soon and i will enjoy some of it but it feels eternal with all that coming.
"No one.... I REPEAT NO ONE, Can be Tony Stark like Robert Downey JR. He is just incredible to watch as Tony Stark."
"just imagine thanos coming back for secret wars, or atleast a variant of thanos, that would make it 10 times better"
"I think what they can do is combine all of the different universes and then have at least 1 or 2 of the same characters from different universes of almost everyone, even though there is maybe over a trillion universes, I think it’s a cool idea"
"Any chance that all the defenders will appear, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil, Iron Fist??"
That Hercules looks horrible
so we really going to start 2023 with wrong thoeries!?! LOL jk
"As much as people want Tom Cruise to be Tony Stark, he seems too soulless to bring the kind of heart to the role that RDJ did. He’s also not funny tbh."
"Just throwing this out there...but if Robert Downey Jr returns...could he come back as an alternate universe Dr. Doom and take on that roll going forward??
🤔 💭 🤔 💭"
I wouldn't really like a full reboot. The lack of reboots (well mostly) is one of the things I really like about the marvel comics.
