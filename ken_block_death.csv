Rallycar has had terribly bad luck with legends like Colin McCrae and now Ken Blocks tragic passing. And neither died in the very sport that is so dangerous.
Why was the snowmobile a complete wreck if it just flipped on top of him?
"Sayonara Mentor, you always my #1. F 43 Green Monster Legend"
"Really Too Sad,
Why him ?
Why now ?
😭"
"Whoa, hero down."

Only got to see Ken through his guest appearances on the BBC Top Gear show but his car control and bravery where unbelievable so sad to be taken from his family too soon he will certainly never be forgotten. God bless him.

"He got me into cars at a very young age, I have no words honestly."

"Why does it always happens to extreme sports person, they die or something terrible happens when doing something so futile. He could have died so many times in tally cars at much faster speed and to die such way is just an anomaly of life. Rip 😢 we will miss you"
Who was this man? Never heard about. He seems to be cool
Fun Fact: Clouds are actually Ken Block doing burnouts in heaven

"Man, It’s very sad to know that he died, he’s such a great man, a racer and a great father for sure, it sure is scary thinking that we just don’t know in what crazy way we’re gonna die, how and when, we’re all gonna drop dead at some point but at least he had a great life and was able to share to million of people his greatness and achievements  thank you for everything, Although I don’t know much about him personally, but I loved every gymkhana videos he’s just a very awesome cool dude and a great person. Rest In Peace Legend."
My condolences to his family All his work will not be forgotten R.I.P
