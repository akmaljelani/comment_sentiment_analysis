At most we could have a slight Cameo from an alternate reality Tony Stark. But I hope it's JUST a cameo. A nod to one of the greatest heroes of all time. But I think we move on to the next generation of heroes. I think Captain America has the potential for a Marvel Special about him returning the stones and his decision to stay in the past. But other than that I'd say a cameo would be good. Anything more than that those two would be too much. A Captain America special + a cameo in Secret Wars and a Cameo from RDJ in secret Wars. That's it. No more.",UCY3T5euj2iApgnTLdggx5XQ,UgywXWV5XmvNnehfZlh4AaABAg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkHd84xNbwo&lc=UgywXWV5XmvNnehfZlh4AaABAg
