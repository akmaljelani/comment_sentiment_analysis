LOCK THEM UP!!!!
He definitely supports Mccarthy.  It's his yes man.
Who cares what that pos thinks?
"Trump remains neutral because he is tired of losing his endorsements. He previously endorsed McCarthy. Now he says ""we'll see"", if he wins then I endorsed him. Biden is so far above trump and his klan because he is a normal person."
Mcarthys tongue isn't long enough
McCarthy is a RINO might as well elect a Democrat. no difference.
Republicans sure do go through a lot of knee pads and chapstick.
Trump don’t want to associate with losers.
The so-called freedom caucus wants the government to fail. So this suits their goal.
Where's his powerful leverage over the party now?!!!!
Trump don’t like him"
Criminals
I hate you.
Trump is shit.
Fuck you trump.
Fuck america
I wonder how much $$$ McCarthy is willing to spend to buy votes? . I'm sure he's working the phones as I post.
I sure hope MTG doesn't get the speaker of the house we will be boom
"The Speaker of the House is next in line of power if something happens to the President and the V. President. Why are you guys not focusing that if McCarthy becomes Speaker of the House, you put a Trump puppet in control who will dictate what he should be doing. McCarthy echoed the Big Lie, the majority of the GOP in Congress supported Trump and his Big Lie and now you still consider that he should still be #3 in line of power?
You guys should be focusing and reporting on 1/6. When that attack on Congress was happening, what was #1, Trump doing? He was inciting, did nothing to stop it, and relished in what was happening on TV coverage. What was #2, Pence doing? He was hiding in his chamber avoiding being taken by the mob who would have hanged him if they got to him. What was #3 doing? Pelosi was calling the National Guard, Homeland Security to get help to protect Congress as well as continue to do their job at hand and that was to continue to Certify the Ballot count for the Electoral College.
I would like to see you guys start to question what was Mccarthy and Jordan doing during this attack? Every single member in office in our country takes an oath of office to serve, protect, defend our country and Constitution from all enemies both Foreign and Domestic. I want to see you guys question what McCarthy and Jordan were doing to protect our country during this time? I want to see the Democrats or Independents ask them in front of the whole chamber in the House, and question McCarthy what was he doing, and what would he have done during the attack if he was Speaker of the House. IT DEFINITELY WOULD NOT BE TO TAKE A TRIP DOWN TO MAR-A-LAGO to kowtow to his Master!"
"McCarthy, the kissing of the ring turned out useless for you. You know the orange vomit will throw anyone under the bus in a heartbeat. You should've known better."
"Let's them self-suicide. Congress works not based on the number. Congress works when all the Represented and elected people work together to help the country survive. House is not the place for the power grab. Make no mistake. House is the place to make laws, not break laws. Dishonest liars should not be allowed."
See what happens when you give your loyalty to Trump? We've seen this again and again and again. Trump throws you away like used toilet paper.
Why ask trump about anything? Why? It just keeps giving him relevance.
I can’t see ANYTHING that would make a NORMAL person want to go through that? I’m embarrassed for you sir.
"Gee,McCarthy, all that butt kissing and nothing to show for it.
Let's be honest about this situation;in this country,there's a Democratic Party and a bunch of facist neonazis thugs who are Republican in name only. 
I say screw these thugs ,let them devour each other.
"True to form, former President sticks it to Rep. McCarthy...after the guy repeatedly goes to Mar-A-Lago to kiss the ring"
McCarthy needs to move his crap out of the Speaker's office.  How humiliating!😵😱😁
Didn't kevin get coffee for the orange one a time or two?? Hahaha
Crooked traitor trump is a death sentence fir republicans
mcarthy will have to clean trump towers or his florida club before he gets trumpers support & then will have to be forever indebted to them
Lmao “we’ll see” he makes it so obvious
traitor white man
"Who cares if he has Trumps bossing!  Trump is so desperate to be popular and viable …….he loves his image as the all powerful  “ GREAT ONE” … Kevin McCarty ares only for power at any cost….the 20 who oppose him are Trump “groupies” who just want to tear up Congress and start over with a new government in their own warped image.   Meanwhile, whose running the government? Isn’t hat we elected them for?"
The stupid party has outdone SNL by making themselves a bigger joke than the SNL crew could ever dream of doing. And director IQ45 has contributed hilariously with attacks on everybody.we love it!
If that LOSER Trump had his way - PUTIN would be the Speaker of the House.
trump wants the job and some clown just might  nominate him
"chaos and dis-functionality
that is the GOP in 2 words"
"Wtf was that at the 1 min mark (give & take 5 seconds). Rarely am I utterly repulsed, but that giggle n crack snort made me stop the video, write this comment, and now move on hoping never to come across this guy's face again."
"The GOP are just a bunch of backstabbing SOB's..., 😆😂🤣😅 !!!"
바이든이 한미일 동맹 유럽 동맹하자해놓고 통수를 쳤어ㅋㅋㅋ 그럼 누가 미국을 믿고 동맹을 하냐ㅋㅋ돈도 못 받고 구라 사기 통수치는 레몬을 누가 글로벌 리더로 인정함? 아 똑같이 사기 통수치는 영국? ㅋㅋㅋ 이거로 바이든 때려 아주 노친네가 못돼쳐먹었드라
"Q has just sent out a message saying that Biden is the mastermind behind this rigged  speakership vote.
Q suggests Trump to call ""Georgia"" to find 20 votes (one more than the 19 votes Kev needed to be Speaker)."
So far the only ones Republicans have owned are themselves.
"Popcorn price will be inflated !
You all will die if support trump
go to hell
go to hell
fucking trump
trump is a bad man
MAGAGA (Newt Gingrich, Carl Rove, Bannon, Roger...) will blame the popcorn-inflation on Biden....again!)"
"Why sud republican join with democrats, why can't democrats join with republicans?"
Drump single handedly destroyed the GQP and McCarthy 's political career. Thank you Donald Drump
Trump's GOP? Duh! Winning!
trump sitting on the fence . . . what a wimp
Why are they feeding trump’s ego by asking if he supports McCarthy
Lol this is what happens when you appoint a narcissist as your party leader lol
I've listened to a lot of coverage and this  particular analyst was spot on
"This is proof that Republicans rig elections. If it were not for the election fraud, Kevin McCarthy would have won the first vote."
"There are partly redacted images of legally cast Republican ballots from the 2020 election online.  This collection I came across shows Republicans were voted for down the entire ticket, but no choice was made for President.  They did not check off Trump for President, but they did check off for Republicans all down the ticket."
Let’s hope 2023 will see the breakup of the GOP
"AOC said that one of the things the 20 reps want is to weaken the speaker's power.  It's interesting.  Also, you should never back up Bunker Boy, he'll drop you like a lead balloon if you have nothing to give to him.  Everything is quid pro quo with Bunker Boy."
McCarthy still kowtow to Trump is unbelievable.
Kevin sold his pathetic soul to Orange Jabba for squat! 😂

"At this point,trump shouldn't even be saying anything politics. He never had good intention on governoning"
"😂 silver tongue devil "" Donnie political shenanigans"""
That giggle.
"Hakeem Jeffries needs 6 votes.  C'mon Congress, get to work!"
Mcarthy will eventually get it.
"""I am the stable genius.""

Oh, yea, a leader who cannot even lead his party in times of need 🤯"
"McCarthy was critical of Trump imediatly after jan  6th.
