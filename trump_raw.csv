Why are you guys not focusing that if McCarthy becomes Speaker of the House, you put a Trump puppet in control who will dictate what he should be doing. McCarthy echoed the Big Lie, the majority of the GOP in Congress supported Trump and his Big Lie and now you still consider that he should still be #3 in line of power?
You guys should be focusing and reporting on 1/6. When that attack on Congress was happening, what was #1, Trump doing? He was inciting, did nothing to stop it, and relished in what was happening on TV coverage. What was #2, Pence doing? He was hiding in his chamber avoiding being taken by the mob who would have hanged him if they got to him. What was #3 doing? Pelosi was calling the National Guard, Homeland Security to get help to protect Congress as well as continue to do their job at hand and that was to continue to Certify the Ballot count for the Electoral College.
I would like to see you guys start to question what was Mccarthy and Jordan doing during this attack? Every single member in office in our country takes an oath of office to serve, protect, defend our country and Constitution from all enemies both Foreign and Domestic. I want to see you guys question what McCarthy and Jordan were doing to protect our country during this time? I want to see the Democrats or Independents ask them in front of the whole chamber in the House, and question McCarthy what was he doing, and what would he have done during the attack if he was Speaker of the House.

They’ve shown the American people exactly who they are in astonishing, shocking, stark relief: a gaggle of squawking, self-serving demagogues, mugging for the cameras, jostling for pride of place, screeching silly sound bites, all the while pretending to serve and govern and balance the budget and close the border (and most importantly—unspoken, of course—keep the people, industries, and interests, domestic and foreign, that have purchased their positions happy). A great show, indeed! Certainly one for the history books—and this is just Act One!!! Please pass the popcorn.
